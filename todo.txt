I am re-doing everything. I will make my own search and find methods, as opposed to using forked project
on github. currently working on this. all the files of the old one will be left untouched, and 
renamed to old.x.html / old.x.css etc.

// solve this using post message.
1. copy the text and display it when the user presses the copy button.

// use data storage to acomplish this.
2. then save the copied text.

3. search the data storage and send user notifications when the code it updated.

4. implement some settings, and the user can change. // bonus.
